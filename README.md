# COMP-586-OOP-Project
Using AngularJS for the first time to create a website with the necessary requirements.
If you are using chrome to run the program, please download the files to a location on your computer and run the following command on Command Prompt:
  "C:\PathTo\Chrome.exe" --allow-file-access-from-files
 Don't forget to change the path to your actual path to chrome.
 Otherwise, running it on Firefox should allow you to see it without furhter manipulation. 
 
 This website is not using databases, as it was my first time ever using AngularJS and learning it by myself with full courseload was tough enough without including a database.
